# Langchain Examples:
Langchain stands as a robust framework designed to empower applications driven by language models. Its capabilities enable applications to:

### Context-Awareness: 
Establish a strong connection between a language model and diverse sources of context, such as prompt instructions, few-shot examples, and contextual content. This ensures that the language model's responses are deeply grounded in the provided context.

### Reasoning Abilities: 
Leverage the language model's reasoning capabilities to make informed decisions. This includes determining how to respond based on the provided context and deciding on appropriate actions to take.


The Langchain framework comprises several essential components:
### Langchain Libraries: 
These libraries are available in both Python and JavaScript, providing essential interfaces and integrations for various components. They include a foundational runtime for seamlessly combining these components into chains and agents. Additionally, the framework offers pre-built implementations of chains and agents for easy integration and deployment.
LangChain empowers developers to build advanced language-driven applications with a focus on context-awareness and sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

## Clarifai Langchain Integration :
* Clarifai is one of first deep learning platforms having been founded in 2013. Clarifai provides an AI platform with the full AI lifecycle for data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation and inference around images, video, text and audio data.
* In the LangChain ecosystem, as far as we're aware, Clarifai is the only provider that supports [LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/clarifai), [embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/clarifai) and a [vectorstore](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/clarifai) in one production scale platform, making it an excellent choice to operationalize your LangChain implementations.

The Integrations folder further divided into Chains and agents, where it consists of example notebooks for various scenarios of using langchain.
