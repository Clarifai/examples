They can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing way than by\\nresisting the great temptation of the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a\\nlarge scale, to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their\\nliberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the visible measure of their\\ncomprehension of their national duty.\\nThe response was amazing in its enthusiastic and general compliance.

Not only did the various classes of\\nworkers and individuals observe the President's suggestions to the letter, but they yielded\\nup individual right after right in order that the war work of the government might be\\nexpedited. Extraordinary powers and functions were granted by the people through\\nCongress, and it was not until peace was declared that these rights and powers returned\\nto the people.\\nThese governmental activities ceased functioning after the war:\\nFood administration;\\nFuel administration;\\nEspionage act;\\nWar trade board;\\nAlien property custodian (with extension of time for certain duties);\\nAgricultural stimulation;\\nHousing construction (except for shipbuilders);\\nControl of telegraphs and telephones;\\nExport control.\", metadata={'source': '/content/history2.txt'})],\n",
