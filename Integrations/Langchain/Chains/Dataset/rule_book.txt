bodywork, the Competitor concerned may ask the Race Director for permission to

26.10 If a driver has serious mechanical difficulties, he must leave the track as soon as it is

safe to do so.
26.11 The lights described in Article 14.3 of the Technical Regulations must be illuminated at

all times when using intermediate or wet-weather tyres. It shall be at the discretion of the
Race Director to decide whether or not a driver should be stopped if no rear light is

28)

POWER UNIT USAGE
28.1 The only power unit that may be used at a Competition during the 2022-2025
Championship seasons is a power unit which is constituted only of elements that were
in conformity, at the date they were introduced in the race pool, with the latest submitted
and approved homologation dossier as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical
Regulations.
28.2

Unless a driver drives for more than one (1) Competitor (see Article 28.4 below), and
subject to the additions described below, each driver may use no more than three (3)
engines (ICE), three (3) motor generator units-heat (MGU-H), three (3) turbochargers
(TC), two (2) energy stores (ES), two (2) control electronics (CE), three (3) motor
generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and eight (8) of each of the four (4) elements constituting
a set of Engine exhaust systems during a Championship. For the purpose of this article
a set of Engine exhaust systems is deemed to comprise the following four (4) elements:
primaries LHS, primaries RHS, secondary LHS and secondary RHS.

28.3

Should a driver use more Power Unit elements than the numbers prescribed in Article
28.2 of any one of the elements during a Championship, a grid place penalty will be
imposed upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used.
Penalties will be applied according to the following table and will be cumulative:
a)

The first time an additional element is used: Ten (10) grid place penalty.

b)

The next times an additional element is used: Five (5) grid place penalty.

If a driver incurs a penalty exceeding fifteen (15) grid places he will be required to start
the race from the back of the starting grid.
Any of the seven (7) elements will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing
transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.
During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same Power
Unit element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at
subsequent Competitions without further penalty.
28.4

If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship his replacement will be
deemed to be the original driver for the purposes of assessing Power Unit usage.

28.5

After consultation with the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer the FIA will attach seals to
each of the relevant elements of the Power Unit prior to them being used for the first time
at a Competition in order to ensure that no significant parts can be rebuilt or replaced.
Exhaust elements defined in Article 28.2 above should be permanently and uniquely
marked, which is then clearly visible directly or using an optical device in a timely manner
when a Power Unit is fitted to a chassis.
Within two (2) hours of the end of the post-race Parc Fermé additional seals will be
applied to all used power unit elements in order to ensure that they cannot be run or
dismantled between Competitions. The sealing method must be agreed with the
Technical Delegate.

2022 Formula 1 Sporting Regulations

26/107

30 September 2022
Issue 2

Upon request to the FIA, these additional seals will be removed twenty-four (24) hours
before the scheduled start of P1 at the next Competition at which the Power Unit
elements are required. All such Power Unit elements must remain within the
Competitor’s designated garage area when not fitted to a car and may not be started at
any time during a Competition other than when fitted to a car eligible to participate in the
Competition.
If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from the relevant components within the
Power Unit after they have been used for the first time those parts may not be used again
unless they were removed under FIA supervision.
29)

USAGE OF RESTRICTED-NUMBER COMPONENTS (RNC)

29.1

Restricted-Number Components (RNC) are components which have a limitation in
numbers that can be used by each driver in a Competition over a Championship.

29.2

For each RNC, each driver may use up to a maximum number of such elements for the
entire Championship, and this maximum value for this RNC will vary as a function of the
Competitions in that Championship, in accordance with to the table of this Article.
a)

Should a driver use more than the allowable maximum value of elements for a
given RNC, a grid penalty will be imposed upon him at the first Competition during
which each additional element is used.

b)

Penalties will be vary between the first time an additional RNC is used, or the
subsequent times, in accordance with the relevant columns of the table of this
Article.

c)

If two additional RNCs are fitted to the same gearbox assembly the first time
each of these are used, the penalty will be the maximum of the penalty stated
between the two types of RNC in the table of this Article, not the sum of the two
penalties.

d)

Any additional RNC will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing
transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.

provisions of this Article are fully respected. This may include, but is not
limited to, an accurate record of the repair work that gets carried out,
photographs, the recording pf part numbers, etc.

iii)

Change gears, dog rings and reverse (excluding final drives or reduction
gears) may be changed under supervision for others of identical specification
at any time during a Competition provided the Technical Delegate is satisfied
there is evident physical damage to the parts in question.

b)

No significant parts of an RNC may be replaced between Competitions, unless
expressly permitted by the FIA.

c)

With the consent of (and at the sole discretion of) the FIA, the numbers above will
be increased in accordance with the relevant column of the table above, if:
i)

The RNC used is supplied by a new Power Unit Manufacturer (as defined in
Appendix 6) for Power Unit RNC’s

ii)

The Competitor in question is participating in their first Championship

d)

If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship Season his replacement
will be deemed to be the original driver for the purposes of assessing the number
of available RNC’s.

e)

During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same
RNC which is subject to penalties, only the last such element fitted may be used
at subsequent Competitions without further penalty.

f)

Penalties applied under the provisions of this Article are cumulative and apply only
to the Competition where they have been incurred.

g)

On four (4) occasions throughout the Championship during P1 and/or P2, a
Competitor may use a gearbox assembly outside of the RNC allocation.

For each RNC, the FIA will determine the appropriate method of identification in order to
ensure that the provisions of Article 29.2 are fully met. This may involve the usage of
seals, the scanning of part numbers, the use of appropriate containers which can be
sealed between Competitions or any other solution that the FIA decides, duly
communicated to the Competitors.
a)

Any seals used will be attached after consultation with the relevant Competitor or
Power Unit supplier.

b)

If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from an RNC after it has been
used for the first time this RNC may not be used again unless the seals were
removed under FIA supervision.
