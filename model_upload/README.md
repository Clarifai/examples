## Clarifai Model Upload Examples

A collection of pre-built models for different tasks. To run inference locally using any of the examples here, some models may require other files such as checkpoints be downloaded before testing and/or deployment to Clarifai as they are ommitted here due to github file size limits.

See the Readme files under each model to see detail instruction of how to download the additional files and deploy the models.

## Prerequisite

Install latest `clarifai`

```bash
pip install --upgrade clarifai
```

Login to the platform for uploading model

```
clarifai login
```
